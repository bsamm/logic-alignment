# Logic Alignment in Teams
*An analysis by Brandon C Sammons*

Standards in group or team output normalize over time. In order for teams to reach their full potiential and ouput their highest quality and quantity of work faster, teams should focus more of their efforts on communication in the early stages of building the team or group. Each individual should strive to be honest and almost overcommunicative about their how they work, when they work, their goals, their passions, and their quirks.

#### Definitions

- Standards Line: The constant standard our output from the team.
- Effort Line: This trace indicates the amount of effort it takes from the team to reach the standards line.
- Q/Q Line: This trace representest the quality and quantity of the team output.
- Communication Margin: The different between the Effort Line and the Q/Q Line line gives us a margin that indicates how much communication is need for the team to output to the standard line.

Efforts start out high and q/q starts out love, but overtime they converge to create a the team standard of work. This applies to teams building product, services, and processes.

The different between the Effort Line and the Q/Q Line create the Communication Margin. This indicates that team should focus on communication more in the realy stages of team development.
