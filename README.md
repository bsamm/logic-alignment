# Logic Alignment in Teams
*An brief analysis by Brandon C Sammons*

Aligning logic refers to the process by which I complete a task, get feedback from my colleagues or supervisor, then incorporate that feedback into the original task. The time it takes to successfully complete this loop will shrink over time as I learn to anticipate my colleague's feedback and generally get better at the process.

Standards in group or team output normalize over time. In order for teams to reach their full potential and output their highest quality and quantity of work faster, teams should focus more of their efforts on communication in the early stages of building the team or group. Each individual should strive to be honest and almost over communicative about how they work, when they work, their goals, their passions, and their quirks.

#### Definitions

- Standards Line: The constant standard our output from the team.
- Effort Line: This trace indicates the amount of effort it takes from the team to reach the standards line.
- Q/Q Line: This trace represents the quality and quantity of the team output.
- Communication Margin: The difference between the Effort Line and the Q/Q Line line gives us a margin that indicates how much communication is needed for the team to output to the standard line.

Efforts start out high and the Q/Q starts out low, but over time they converge to create the team's standard of work. This applies to teams building product, services, and processes.
